## 💔 The Silent Crisis

Every night, thousands of Indian students stare at their phones, drowning in anxiety...

- **"What if I fail JEE again?"**
- **"My parents will be so disappointed..."**
- **"I can't tell anyone how I really feel..."**

**25%** of Indian youth battle anxiety and depression in silence.  
**85%** suffer alone because therapy is expensive, stigmatized, and feels impossible to access.

### The Breaking Point

When a student in Kota ends their life. When a teenager cries alone after board results. When family pressure becomes unbearable...

**Who do they turn to?**

## 💡 Meet SAATHI - A Friend Who Always Listens

**SAATHI** isn't just an app. It's the friend who's awake at 3 AM when panic strikes. The listener who doesn't judge. The support system that understands *your* struggles.

### ✨ No login. No judgment. Just someone who cares.

Because sometimes, you just need someone to hear you say:

*"I'm tired of pretending I'm okay."*

---

## 🌟 What Makes SAATHI Different?

### 🧠 **Understands YOU**
Not generic Western advice. SAATHI gets it:
- The crushing weight of JEE/NEET preparation
- Parents comparing you to Sharma ji's kid
- The fear of "log kya kahenge" (what will people say)
- Feeling trapped between dreams and expectations

### 🗣️ **Speaks YOUR Language**
*"Yaar, bohot stress ho raha hai"* or *"I can't take this anymore"*  
SAATHI understands both. Natural Hinglish, just like talking to a friend.

### 🚨 **There When Crisis Strikes**
When thoughts get dark, SAATHI recognizes distress and immediately provides:
- Verified helplines (KIRAN: 1800-599-0019)
- Crisis resources
- Gentle reminders that you matter

### 🔒 **Your Secrets Stay Safe**
100% anonymous. No phone numbers. No emails. No judgment.  
Just pure, private support when you need it most.

## 💝 From Our Hearts

We built SAATHI because we've been there.

We've felt the 3 AM panic. The exam pressure. The family expectations. The loneliness of suffering in silence.

**We built the friend we wish we had.**

---

## 👥 Team

**[Ankur Ojha]** - Students who refused to accept that youth should suffer alone.

*"We're not just building an app. We're starting a movement."*

---

## 🙏 A Message to Judges

Every 40 seconds, someone loses their life to suicide globally.  
In India, student suicides are at an all-time high.

**SAATHI can't solve everything. But it can be there when it matters most.**

The question isn't whether we need this.  
**The question is: How many lives could we have saved if we had this sooner?**
